			<h4>The Problem</h4>
			<img src="financialproblems.jpg"><br>
			The current challenges SAKADAB is facing are financial problems. SAKADAB is an institution which provides housing 
			and livelihood for PWDs. However, their lack of funding makes them unable to fulfil all of their needs. According 
			to their official website, their priority needs are a multi-purpose hall, a health center, a partition of the 
			mess hall and kitchen, metal craft, carpentry tools & equipment, a covered walkway and roofing of the external kitchen. <br><br><br>
			<h4>The Intervention</h4>
			<img src="promotion.jpg"><br>
			The promotion of the handicrafts produced by our partner institution is a project that we suggest. Crafted consumer goods 
			like individualized keychains and face masks are sold by SAKADAB. According to a document prepared by Nathaniel Limbo, 
			the AdDU jhs community can assist SAKADAB by promoting the products they sell. Since a lot of people from our generation are 
			inclined to social media, it would be a great idea to utilize the internet for this matter. Reposting content from their Facebook 
			page and creating our own educational content to share on various social media platforms are good places to start. This idea can 
			benefit the institution in the long run since the material we post on social media is not simply withdrawn, and because when people 
			share the stuff we promote, we reach more people and educate them. <br><br>
			The project prioritizes the promotion of handicraft products SAKADAB offers. The main problem of our institution is their 
			lack of funding. This causes them to have a hard time acquiring needed medication and necessary parts of their facility. 
			SAKADAB has talked about their difficulties in buying medicine and their plans on renovating and adding more places in their 
			facility. However, due to their financial problems, it is hard for them to achieve this. This project aims to promote the institution 
			and their services and products to the public and encourage people to visit SAKADAB. Since their only source of income is through 
			handicraft products, advertising or promoting this can greatly help them. If the project is a success, the institution can achieve 
			financial stability and buy medications with ease. They can also provide more centers and renovate their facilities to promote their advocacy.<br><br>
			In addition to this, we highly encourage businesses and companies to partner up with SAKADAB to better promote their products. This is also to
			hopefully employ the beneficiaries and to stabilize their income. <br><br><br>

		<h4>Why is this project important for the institution?</h4>				
			<p>
		<img src="sakadablogo.jpg"/><br>
		This project is important for the institution to help SAKADAB be financially stable. With the help of promoting their handicraft products and encouraging businesses to partner with SAKADAB will help them have a stable income and be financially stable. This is important for the institution to support themselves financially and implementing their advocacy.
		<br><br><br><br>
		<h4>Why is this project important for Ateneo students?</h4>	
		<img src="ateneologo.jpg"/><br>
		This project is important to Ateneo students for them to learn the importance of helping others in need. Since SAKADAB has mentioned their problems, we students from Ateneo, can practice the values taught to us by helping our partner institution. This can also be an opportunity for the students to use knowledge from classroom discussions and applying them to real life.
		<br><br><br><br>
		<h4>Why is this project important for the public in general?</h4>	
		<img src="public.jpg"/><br>
		This is important to the public to help inform them and make them aware about SAKADAB's problems. This can encourage them to give a helping hand to the needy and to show compassion to them. Since the institution sells consumable products, the public can buy customizable products from them. Namely, face masks, handicrafts, key chains, and many more. This can be a mutual relationship for both the institution and the public. <br><br>
